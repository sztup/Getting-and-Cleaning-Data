# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the "Getting and Cleaning data" course project.


## Dataset used

The analysed dateset is from an experiment of 30 volunteers performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz.
The experiment itself is about classification and clustering (i.e. identifying the activity based on the meassurements), but this exercise is just about boring stuff.

The dataset is available from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


## Results, files needed to be submitted

1. `tidy_HAR_dateset.txt` a tidy data set, the output of the 5th step (e.g. average of each variable for each activity and each subject.)

2. `run_analysis.R` the code to perform the analyses: downloading, loading, cleaning, etc.

3. `CodeBook.md` a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called.

4. `README.md` in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
